# MindMap
MindMap is a software to build them. Mind maps are usally useful for students but you can apply to all kind of stuffs. This application is browser-based so it can ben used from everywhere and everyone. There are some of mine maps inside `src/` folder.

## How to use it
* **1# Add data:** first of all you should create your data. Data is fromatted using JSON and stored in 'src/filedataname.json'. JSON is an open format to transmit data object consisting of attribute-values pairs, it is pretty easy to learn, here a [link from tutsplus.com](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-json--active-8817). /* insert an example */
* **2# Visualize map:** open with your browser `printable-mindmap.html` and in your url bar append to the address `f=filename` as GET parameter. So you should have something like `file:///your/path/to/printable-mindmap.html?f=filedataname`. Type `Return` to run this URL.
